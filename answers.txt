What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge allows you to combine changes from a source branch into the target branch. On the other hand, rebase allows you to transfer the changes from a branch into another branch.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is when a project is hosted on a network or just the internet instead of your local machine.
